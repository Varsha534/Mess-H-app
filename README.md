# Mess-H-app

We developed an Mess feedback and review web application using Django for improving the quality of mess food and hygiene. Additionally the mess staff could update the weekly menu and its ingredients of the dishes (in case of allergies) on the web app for everyone to view. The application will generate a weekly statistics of the feedback and suggestions so that necessary changes could be made by the staff.
